# Stay Fresh: TDD
<img src="http://www.factfiend.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fresh1.jpg">

In a nutshell, TDD is a way that developers work to build high quality programs and prevent errors/bugs from developing in the program. Developers first write tests that check to make sure that their code is doing what itâ€™s supposed to be doing.

Tests are written using a program called Rspec (among others), and the tests can be found in files ending in spec.rb. For example, if you have a ruby file called test.rb, the tests would be written in a file called test_spec.rb.

To run tests, go to the root of your project and type rspec - The tests will run and you'll see the failures that you have to work on.

Failures are good. Let me repeat: FAILURES ARE GOOD. They are breadcrumbs on the path to success. Read the failures carefully, change your code, and run rspec again until everything is passing.


Want to keep up your TDD chops while you're away? Here are a few activities and problems you can work on:
